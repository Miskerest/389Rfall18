### Part 2 (75 pts)

First I would disclose the vulnerabilities to my superiors, making sure to indicate the possible negative consequences if the vulnerabilities are not addressed. At this point, a responsible company would take steps to ensure the issues are resolved and the safety of consumers is not at risk. If this isn't the case, after confirmation that the company is not going to fix the issue, I would take it public. First, a disclosure to a consumer watchdog group with vague/nonspecific details about the security hole. This ensures that if the information is leaked, it's more difficult to create a working proof-of-concept and potentially cause harm to consumers. Next action would be to possibly contact a government agency to force action on the company's part. Disclosure to the public is only a last resort, as once a proof-of-concept is out in the wild, anyone with malicious intent can leverage it to potentially harm people.

If I chose not to do anything to address the issue, I would consider myself responsible for any harm that results. Assuming that I'm the only one with the information regarding the security issues, allowing them to go unchecked could cause physical harm to person and property. As a result, I would be at fault, and could personally be liable for failure to report the issues.
